# 🎉 Day 2 - Loading Animation

This project features a captivating loading animation created using HTML and CSS. The animation consists of glowing circles that rotate and scale, set against a vibrant background that changes colors.

## 🚀 Demo

## 💻 Technologies Used

## 🎨 How It Works
The loader is made up of multiple `<span>` elements that rotate around a central point.  
Each span element has a glowing effect created using CSS box-shadow.  
The background color continuously changes using a hue-rotate animation.

- **Colors:** Modify the background color and the glow effect color in the CSS file.
- **Loader Size:** Change the width and height of the loader in the `.loader` class.
